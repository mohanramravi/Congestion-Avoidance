# Congestion-Avoidance

In high-density urban environments, traffic congestion is a pervasive problem that impacts daily life, economy, and the environment. To address this challenge, I propose a real-time traffic congestion detection and management system utilizing deep learning on the captured images. The system leverages advanced deep learning models to detect and vehicles in the images. Through analysis of traffic flow seen through the image, the system identifies congestion, distinguishing them from normal uncongested roads![Uploading image.png…]()
